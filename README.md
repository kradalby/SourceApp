# SourceApp

This app lets you monitor game servers based on Valve's Source Engine.

It uses [SourceAPI](https://source.fap.no/) to fetch somewhat usful information about the server.

This is mainly a project to learn Swift and iOS development.

## Compatibility
Currently, the application is tested with the following games:

* Counter-Strike Global offensive
* Counter-Strike Source
* Team-fortress 2
* Day of defeat: Source
* Half-life 2: Death match
* Insurgency

Other Source engine servers should also work fine.
